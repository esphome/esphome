## `reboot_timeout` with a fallback AP (#9958)

Only one board runs the AP at a time, or stations join the wrong one. AP probe: bogus network,
`ap: {ssid, password, ap_timeout: 5s}`, `reboot_timeout: 60s`, `logger: level: VERBOSE` (ESP32 and
ESP8266 log `AP client connected MAC=` at verbose), `on_boot: logger.log: BOOT`. Station probes:
`reboot_timeout: 0s`, `interval: 150s` running `wifi.disable`, `delay: 20s`, `wifi.enable` (60 s cycles
are too short to cover the due moment). Pass pattern: "Can't connect; rebooting" exactly 60 s after boot
with no station joined, no reboot for minutes while one is, then a reboot within a second of the last
disconnect. The BW15 restarts its AP on every STA retry and cannot be tested this way.

## DHCP lease cache (#17767)

Cycle 20 s awake, `deep_sleep.enter 30s`, wake, 20 s, `App.safe_reboot()`, logging `millis()` at the
`wifi.connected` condition. An RTS hardware reset must fall back to DHCP; a software reboot and a deep
sleep wake must apply the cache. `esphome run --no-logs` silently skipped the upload on one board; use
`upload` then `logs`.

## Wi-Fi Easy Connect (DPP) enrollee (#17934)

Only an Android phone configures: Settings, network details, Add device, Share Wi-Fi (the Wi-Fi list's
QR scanner makes the phone an enrollee). Render the URI with the `qrcode` module and open the PNG.
`esp32: framework: log_level: DEBUG` plus `sdkconfig_options: CONFIG_WPA_DEBUG_PRINT: y` prints the
supplicant state machine.
