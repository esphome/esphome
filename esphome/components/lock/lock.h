/** This class is used to encode all control actions on a lock device.
 *
 * It is supposed to be used by all code that wishes to control a lock device (mqtt, api, lambda etc).
 * Create an instance of this class by calling `id(lock_device).make_call();`. Then set all attributes
 * with the `set_x` methods. Finally, to apply the changes call `.perform();`.
 *
 * The integration that implements the lock device receives this instance with the `control` method.
 * It should check all the properties it implements and apply them as needed. It should do so by
 * getting all properties it controls with the getter methods in this class. If the optional value is
 * set (check with `.has_value()`) that means the user wants to control this property. Get the value
 * of the optional with the star operator (`*call.get_state()`) and apply it.
