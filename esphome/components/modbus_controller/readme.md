# Modbus controller component

## A fork of [esphome](https://github.com/esphome/esphome) adding support for monitoring a modbus device

Initially I created this component only for the EPEVER Trace solar controller (You can find that implementation in the epever branch here. )
Since alot of my code was already pretty generic I decided to create a general modbus component instead.

Modbus_controller suppors sensors, binary_sensors, text_sensors and switches
Custom command can be sent to the device using lambdas.

Tested using an EPEVER Tracer2210AN MPPT controller, Heidelberg Wallbox and PZEM-017

* Switch to register_type
* Add lambda support

### A new breaking change.

Switching from using `modbus_function_code' to 'register_type'. The code is picking best function code on it's own.
Configuration is also less confusing. The options are 'coil', 'read', 'discret-input' and 'holding'.
Right now a warning is emmited when you compile the project but . This is just a warning and you can continue to use `modbus_function_code` .
However once (if at all :)) the PR gets merged only `register_type` will be supported.

The options are he options are 'coil', 'read', 'discret-input' and 'holding'.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: modbus_controller
    modbus_controller_id: epever
    id: battery_capacity
    address: 0x9001
    name: "Battery Capacity"
    modbus_functioncode: read_holding_registers
    value_type: U_WO
```

change to

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: modbus_controller
    modbus_controller_id: epever
    id: battery_capacity
    address: 0x9001
    name: "Battery Capacity"
    register_type: holding
    value_type: U_WORD
```

Here is a sed script to update the configuration for you

```
#!/bin/bash
yaml=$1
echo updating $yaml
sed -i 's/modbus_functioncode\:[[:space:]]*\"*read_coils\"*/register_type\: coil/' $yaml
sed -i 's/modbus_functioncode\:[[:space:]]*\"*read_discrete_inputs\"*/register_type\: discret_input/' $yaml
sed -i 's/modbus_functioncode\:[[:space:]]*\"*read_input_registers\"*/register_type\: read/' $yaml
sed -i 's/modbus_functioncode\:[[:space:]]*\"*read_holding_registers\"*/register_type\: holding/' $yaml
sed -i 's/modbus_functioncode\:[[:space:]]*\"*write_single_coil\"*/register_type\: coil/' $yaml
sed -i 's/modbus_functioncode\:[[:space:]]*\"*write_single_register\"*/register_type\: holding/' $yaml
sed -i 's/modbus_functioncode\:[[:space:]]*\"*write_multiple_coils\"*/register_type\: coil/' $yaml
sed -i 's/modbus_functioncode\:[[:space:]]*\"*write_multiple_registers\"*/register_type\: holding/' $yaml
```

### Add lambda support

The lambda is called just before calling `sensor:: Sensor::publish_state` .
Filters will be applied after the lambda was called.

Parameters passed to the lambda
* `x` contains the parsed value as float
* `data` contains the raw modbus response bytes `std::vector<uint8_t>`
* `item` a pointer to the sensor item.
The lambda can return a float value that will be used as the new state for this sensor.
If the lambda doesn't return a value `sensor::Sensor::publish_state` will not be called. This gives you the option to handle the value in a different way

This example logs the value as parsed and the raw modbus bytes received for this register range

```yaml
  - platform: modbus_controller
    modbus_controller_id: epever
    id: battery_capacity
    address: 0x9001
    name: "Battery Capacity"
    register_type: holding
    value_type: U_WORD
    lambda: !lambda |-
      ESP_LOGI("","Lambda incoming value=%f - data array size is %d",x,data.size());
      ESP_LOGI("","Sensor properties: adress = 0x%X, offset = 0x%X value type=%d",item->start_address,item->offset,item->sensor_value_type);
      int i=0 ;
      for (auto val : data) {
        ESP_LOGI("","data[%d]=0x%02X (%d)",i++ ,data[i],data[i]);
      }
      return x ;
```

## Note: Sep.13

Added support for modbus number and output data types

Output receives a value between 0 and 1.0 from the frontend or other sensors.
This value can be scaled to the desired range using multiply.
For more complex conversions lambda can be used (multiply is ignored then).
The new value is passed to the lambda  as `float x` and an empty vector is passed in as `std::vector<uint16_t>&payload`

You can define the payload by adding data to payload then the return value is ignored and the content of payload is used.

### Output

```yaml
output:
    - platform: modbus_controller
        modbus_controller_id: epever
        id: battery_capacity_output
        lambda: !lambda |-
          ESP_LOGD("main","Modbus Output incoming value = %f",x);
          uint16_t b_capacity = x ;
          payload.push_back(b_capacity);
          // return value ignored because the payload has been set
          return x * 1.0 ;
        # ignored
        multiply: 1.0
        address: 0x9001
        value_type: U_WORD
```

### Number

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: modbus_controller
    modbus_controller_id: epever
    id: battery_capacity
    address: 0x9001
    name: "Battery Capacity"
    register_type: holding
    value_type: U_WORD

number:
  - platform: modbus_controller
    modbus_controller_id: epever
    modbus_sensor_id: epever
    id: battery_capacity_number
    name: "Battery Cap Number"
    lambda: !lambda |-
      ESP_LOGD("main lambda","Modbus Number incoming value = %f",x);
      uint16_t b_capacity = x ;
      // add the payload directly
      payload.push_back(b_capacity);
      // ignored because payload is set
      return x * 1.0 ;
    # ignored because lambda is defined
    multiply: 100.0

```

## Note - breaking change ##

With the [commit from Sept.12](https://github.com/martgras/esphome/commit/b099b3e3bbf6261e2b6bae1e3f08c8693006d3bf) modbus_controller no longer supports defining sensors, binary_sensors etc.. directly below the modbus_controller component. Instead the esphome default way of defining items is used.

```yaml
modbus_controller:
  - id: epever
    ## the Modbus device addr
    address: 0x1
    sensors:
      - id: array_rated_voltage
        name: "array_rated_voltage2"
        address: 0x3000
        offset: 0
        unit_of_measurement: "V"
        register_type: read
        value_type: U_WORD
        accuracy_decimals: 1
        skip_updates: 60
        filters:
          - multiply: 0.01

## Hardware setup

I'm using a cheap RS 485 module connected to an ESP32

![RS 485 Modul](https://i.stack.imgur.com/plH1X.jpg)

See [How is this RS485 Module Working?](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/244425/how-is-this-rs485-module-working) on stackexchange for more details

To connect the RS 485 Module to the controller I cut off one side of an ethernet cable and connected PIN 3 (or 4)  to A+, PIN 5 (or 6) to B+ and 7 (or 8 to Ground).  Ground is also connected to GND.
The interface with ESP32 is GPIO PIN 25 to TXD PIN 27 to RXD . 3.3V to VCC and GND to GND.
The pins used on the ESP32 side can be changed there is no special reason I chose 25/27 except that most of my ESP32 boards have them available

## Software setup

There are several options to use this component.

#### Clone my repository

```
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/martgras/esphome.git -b modbus_component

# Install ESPHome
cd esphome/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_test.txt
pip3 install -e .

esphome <path to your config.yaml> run

```

#### Reference modbus controller as an external component

Instead of cloning my repository you can use modbus_controller as an external component (Kudos to @derwolff for this hint)
 )

`

```
external_components:
  # use  GitHub
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/martgras/esphome
      ref: testing
    components: [ modbus_controller, modbus ]
esphome:
  name: dc
  platform: ESP32
  board: esp32dev
...
modbus_controller:
...
```

### Configuration

Modbus sensors can be directly defined (inline) under the modbus_controller hub or as standalone components

Technically there is no difference between the "inline" and the standard definitions approach.
Because the project started supporting only "inline" I'm keeping it in the code because it doesn't impact the code size and is a bit more convenient. The additional work to support both schemata is done in the python scripts generating the C++ code

`

```
uart:
  id: mod_bus
  tx_pin: 19
  rx_pin: 18
  baud_rate: 115200
  stop_bits: 1

modbus:
  #flow_control_pin: 23
  send_wait_time: 200ms
  id: mod_bus_epever

modbus_controller:

    address: 0x1
    modbus_id: mod_bus_epever
    command_throttle: 0ms

    value_type: U_WORD
    accuracy_decimals: 1
    skip_updates: 0

```

### Format

Define an register in YAML

```yaml
    sensors:
      - id: length_of_night
        address: 0x9065
        offset: 0
        bitmask: default value is 0xFFFFF # some values are packed in a single response word. Bitmask can be used to extract the relevant parts
        name: 'Length of night'
        register_type: holding
        value_type: U_WORD
        scale_factor: 1.0
```

modbus_sensor_schema extends the sensors schema and adds these parameters:
  + modbus_functioncode: type of register
  + address: start address of the first register in a range
  + offset: offset from start address in bytes. If more than one register is read a modbus read registers command this value is used to find the start of this datapoint relative to start address. The component calculates the size of the range based on offset and size of the value type
  + value_type:
    - U_WORD (unsigned float from 1 register =16bit
    - S_WORD (signed float from one register)
    - U_DWORD (unsigned float from 2 registers = 32bit)
    - S_DWORD (unsigned float from 2 registers = 32bit)
    - U_DWORD_R (unsigend float from 2 registers low word first )
    - S_DWORD_R (sigend float from 2 registers low word first )
    - U_QWORD (unsigned float from 4 registers = 64bit
    - S_QWORD (signed float from 4 registers = 64bit
    - U_QWORD_R (unsigend float from 4 registers low word first )
    - S_QWORD_R (sigend float from 4 registers low word first )

modbus defines serveral register types and function codes to access them.
The following function codes are implemented

    - "read_coils": Function 01 (01hex) Read Coils - Reads the ON/OFF status of discrete coils in the device.
    - "read_discrete_inputs": Function 02(02hex) - Reads the ON/OFF status of discrete inputs in the device.
    - "read_holding_registers": Function 03 (03hex) Read Holding Registers - Read the binary contents of holding registers in the device.
    - "read_input_registers": Function 04 (04hex) Read Input Registers - Read the binary contents of input registers in the device.
    - "write_single_coil": Function 05 (05hex) Write Single Coil - Writes a single coil to either ON or OFF.
    - "write_single_register": Function 06 (06hex) Write Single Register - Writes a value into a single holding register.
    - "write_multiple_coils": Function 15 (0Fhex) Write Multiple Coils - Writes each coil in a sequence of coils to either ON or OFF.
    - "write_multiple_registers": Function 16 (10hex) Write Multiple Registers - Writes values into a sequence of holding registers

#### modbus component:

  + platform: modbus_controller
  + cmodbus_id: id of the modbus hub
  + command_throttle:  milliseconds between 2 requests to the device. Some devices limit the rate of requests they can handle (e.g. only 1 request/s).
  + id: component id
  + address: modbus device address

#### sensor

  + modbus_functioncode: type of register
  + address: start address of the first register in a range
  + offset: offset from start address in bytes. If more than one register is read a modbus read registers command this value is used to find the start of this datapoint relative to start address.
    - for coil or discrete input registers offset is the position of the coil/register because these registers encode 8 coils in one byte.
  + bitmask: some values are packed in a response. The bitmask can be used to extract a value from the response.  For example, the high byte value register 0x9013 contains the minute value of the current time. To only extract this value use bitmask: 0xFF00.  The result will be automatically right shifted by the number of 0 before the first 1 in the bitmask.  For 0xFF00 (0b1111111100000000) the result is shifted 8 positions.  More than one sensor can use the same address/offset if the bitmask is different.

#### binarysensor

  + modbus_functioncode: type of register
  + address: start address of the first register in a range
  + offset: offset from start address in bytes. If more than one register is read a modbus read registers command this value is used to find the start of this datapoint relative to start address.
    - for coil or discrete input registers offset is the position of the coil/register because these registers encode 8 coils in one byte.
  + bitmask: some values are packed in a response. The bitmask is used to determined if the result is true or false

#### text sensor:

   - modbus_functioncode: type of register
   - address: start address of the first register in a range
   - offset: offset from start address in bytes. If more than one register is read a modbus read registers command this value is used to find the start of this datapoint relative to start address.
   - response_size: response number of bytes of the response
   - raw_encode: (NONE, HEXBYTES, COMMA)     If the response is binary data it can't be published. Since a text sensor only publishes strings the binary data can encoded

     - HEXBYTES :  2 byte hex string. 0x2011 will be sent as "2011".
     - COMMA  : Byte values as integers, delimited by a coma. 0x2011 will be sent as "32,17"
     This allows you to process the data in a on_value lambda. See the example below how to convert the binary time data to a string and also how to set the time of the controller

   - register_count: The number of registers this data point spans. Default is 1
   - bitmask: some values are packed in a single response word. bitmask is used to convert to a bool value. For example, bit 8 of the register 0x3200 indicates an battery error. Therefore, if the bitmask is 256. the operation is `result = (raw value & bitmask != 0)` . More than one sensor can use the same address/offset if the bitmask is different

#### switch

  + modbus_functioncode: type of register
  + address: start address of the first register in a range
  + offset: offset from start address in bytes. If more than one register is read a modbus read registers command this value is used to find the start of this datapoint relative to start address.
    - for coil or discrete input registers offset is the position of the coil/register because these registers encode 8 coils in one byte.
  + bitmask: applied before sending the value to the controller

modbus_switch works like modbus_binarysensor. modbus_functioncode should be the code to read the value from the device. The write command will be created based on the function code.
To define a switch for a coil function code should be "read_coils". The command to change the setting will then be write_single_coil
Example

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: modbus_controller
    modbus_controller_id: epever
    id: enable_load_test
    register_type: coil
    address: 2
    offset: 3
    name: "enable load test mode"
    bitmask: 1
```

Since offset is not zero the read command is part of a range and will be parseed when the range is updated.
The write command to be constructed uses the function code to determine the write command. For a coil it is "write single coil".
Because the write command only touches one register start_address and offset need to be adjusted.
The final command will be write_single_coil address 5 (start_address+offset) value 1 or 0

For holding registers the write command will be "write_single_register". Because the offset for holding registers is given in bytes and the size of a register is 16 bytes the start_address is calculated as start_address + offset/2

## TIP

Write support is only implemented for switches.
However the C++ code already has the required methods to write to a modbus register

These methods can be called from a lambda.
Here is an example how to set the rtc clock of a EPEVER Trace AN controller.
The time is set by writing 12 bytes to register 0x9013.
The code reads the current time of the controller using a text sensor and compares it with the time of the esp.
If they differ the time of the esp is sent to the EPEVER controller.

```yaml
    ...
    text_sensor:
      - platform: modbus_controller
        modbus_controller_id: epever
        name: "rtc_clock"
        id: rtc_clock
        internal: true
        register_type: holding
        address: 0x9013
        address: 0
        register_count: 3
        raw_encode: HEXBYTES
        response_size: 6

### High Level Code Structure ###

all modbus items (modbus_sensor, modbus_binary_sensor...) derive from ModbusItem and are stored in a map where the start-address + offfset .. is the key

At setup the map is enumerated and scanned for contigous ranges (items with the same start address). Theses ranges are stored in a list.
For each range a modbus command to read all datapoints in the range is constructed.

During update the ranges are enumerated and their read commands are queued to the send queue.

When the command has been sent it is moved to the incoming data queue - waiting for processing of the raw data.

In loop if the incoming que is not empty the raw data is processed.

  items contained in current range are enurmerated and call parse_and_publish.

  The items extract the data from the raw response for the range using offset and bitmask

If there is no incoming data pending commands from the send queue are sent out.
