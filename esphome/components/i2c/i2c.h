/** The I2CComponent is the base of ESPHome's i2c communication.
 *
 * It handles setting up the bus (with pins, clock frequency) and provides nice helper functions to
 * make reading from the i2c bus easier (see read_bytes, write_bytes) and safe (with read timeouts).
 *
 * For the user, it has a few setters (see set_sda_pin, set_scl_pin, set_frequency)
 * to setup some parameters for the bus. Additionally, the i2c component has a scan feature that will
 * scan the entire 7-bit i2c address range for devices that respond to transmissions to make finding
 * the address of an i2c device easier.
 *
 * On the ESP32, you can even have multiple I2C bus for communication, simply create multiple
 * I2CComponents, each with different SDA and SCL pins and use `set_parent` on all I2CDevices that use
 * the non-first I2C bus.
