/*
 * This class stores an array of aggregates for a sliding window of measurements/aggregate chunks. It has two main
 * functions:
 *  - Add a new aggregate chunk to the sliding window queue (insert function)
 *  - Evict the oldest aggregate chunk from the sliding window queue (evict function)
 *
 * The class can continuously collect measurements and compute summary statistics over a sliding window. The
 * oldest measurements/aggregate chunks can be evicted, and new measurements/aggregate chunks can be inserted. Its
 * calculations are numerically stable with minimal computational complexity. Each measurement/aggregate chunk in the
 * window is stored in memory along with two additional aggregates (mid_sum_ and back_sum_).
 *
 * The approach is based on the De-Amortized Banker's Aggregator (DABA) Lite algorithm. The code follows
 * https://github.com/IBM/sliding-window-aggregators/blob/master/cpp/src/DABALite.hpp (Apache License, accessed June
 * 2023) and the reference paper "In-order sliding-window aggregation in worst-case constant time" by Kanat
 * Tangwongsan, Martin Hirzel, and Scott Schneider (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00778-021-00668-3).
 *
 * The measurements/aggregate chunks are stored in a pre-allocated circular queue. The DABA Lite algorithm keeps track
 * of 6 indices, and the CircularQueueIndex class implements the details.
 *
 * Time complexity (for n aggregate chunks, where each may aggregate multiple measurements):
 *  - insertion of new measurement/aggregate chunk: O(1)
 *  - evicting oldest measurement/aggregate chunk: O(1)
 *  - clearing entire queue: O(1)
 *  - computing current aggregate: O(1)
 *
 * Memory usage (for n aggregate chunks, where each may aggregate multiple measurements):
 *  - n+2 aggregates
 *
 * Implemented by Kevin Ahrendt for the ESPHome project, June and July 2023
