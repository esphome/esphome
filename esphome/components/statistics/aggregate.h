/*
 * Aggregate class stores summary statistics for a set of measurements. It is mathematically a monoid paired with a
 * binary operation and an identity. It has three main purposes:
 *  - Set a default value for a null measurement (a set with 0 measurements) - Aggregate constructor
 *    - This is the identity monoid
 *  - Combine two aggregates from two disjoint sets of measurements - combine_with method
 *    - This is the binary operation
 *    - Summary statistics are combined using parallel algorithms
 *      - See the article "Numerically Stable Parallel Computation of (Co-)Variance" by Schubert and Gertz for details
 *  - Compute summary statistics from the stored aggregates - get_* and compute_* methods
 *    - Some summary statistics are directly stored
 *      - argmax, argmin, count, duration, min, mean, and max
 *      - Use get_* methods for retrieval
 *    - Some of the stored summary statistics in the monoid are not useful immediately but can be combined with other
 *      stored measurements to compute a useful statistic
 *      - Covariance uses the stored count (or duration if time-weighted) and C2 statistics
 *        - C2 uses the mean, count (or duration if time-weighted), and timestamp mean for the combine operation
 *      - Linear correlation of deterimination uses C2, M2, and timestamp M2 statistics
 *      - Trend is computed using C2 and timestamp M2 statistics
 *        - timestamp M2 statistic additionally requires the timestamp mean and count (or duration if time-weighted)
 *          for the combine operation
 *      - Variance and standard deviation are computed using the stored count (or duration if time-weighted) and M2
 *        statistics
 *        - M2 requires the mean statistic and count (or duration if time-weighted) for the combine operation
 *      - Use compute_* methods for retrieval
 *
 * For any statistic that uses timestamp_mean, the Aggregate also stores timestamp_reference.
 *  - timestamp_reference is the offset (in milliseconds) for the timestamp_mean
 *  - timestamp_means need to be normalized before combined so that they reference the same timestamp
 *    - The normalizing process involves finding the time delta between the two references; this avoids issues from
 *      millis() rolling over
 *  - This approach ensures one of the timestamp_reference's is 0 when combining two Aggregates
 *    - This makes timestamp_mean as small as possible to minimize floating point precision issues
 *
 * Implemented by Kevin Ahrendt for the ESPHome project, June and July 2023
