/*
 * This class stores an array of aggregates, which combined give summary statistics for all measurements inserted.
 * It has two main functions
 *  - Combine with a new Aggregate (insert function)
 *  - Reset to a null Aggregate (clear function)
 *
 * This is used to aggregate continuously collected measurements into summary statistics. Aggregates in the array
 * are combined when they aggregate the same number of measurements. As Aggregates combine only with the same size
 * samples, this approach is numerically stable for any quantity of measurements. It has a slight penalty in terms of
 * computational complexity and memory usage. Memory is pre-allocated. If no specific capacity is specified, it
 * allocates enough memory for 2^(QUEUE_CAPACITY_IF_NONE_SPECIFIED)) Aggregates to be inserted. If that capacity is
 * exceeded, then an overflow is handled by aggregating everything in the queue into one Aggregate. Repeated overflow
 * handling can cause numerical instability in the long term.
 *
 *
 * Example run: At each numbered step, insert a new Aggregate with count=1. queue_ is the set of aggregates in the
 * queue, and each Aggregate is denoted by its count.
 *
 *  1) queue_ = {1}
 *
 *  2) queue_ = {1,1}
 *     queue_ = {2}     // right-most elements have the same count, so they are combined
 *
 *  3) queue_ = {2,1}
 *
 *  4) queue_ = {2,1,1}
 *     queue_ = {2,2}   // right-most elements have the same count, so they are combined
 *     queue_ = {4}     // right-most elements have the same count, so they are combined
 *
 *  5) queue_ = {4,1}
 *
 *  6) queue_ = {4,1,1}
 *     queue_ = {4,2}   // right-most elements have the same count, so they are combined
 *
 *  7) queue_ = {4,2,1}
 *
 *  8) queue_ = {4,2,1,1}
 *     queue_ = {4,2,2} // right-most elements have the same count, so they are combined
 *     queue_ = {4,4}   // right-most elements have the same count, so they are combined
 *     queue_ = {8}     // right-most elements have the same count, so they are combined
 *
 *
 * Time complexity (for n aggregate chunks, where each may aggregate multiple measurements):
 *  - insertion of new measurement: worst case O(log(n))
 *  - clear queue: O(1)
 *  - computing current aggregate: worst case O(log(n))
 *
 * Memory usage (for n aggregate chunks, where each may aggregate multiple measurements):
 *  - log(n)+1 aggregates
 *
 *
 * Implemented by Kevin Ahrendt for the ESPHome project, June and July 2023
